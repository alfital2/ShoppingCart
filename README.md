In this project i wanted to demonstrate my abilities to use to principles of OOP by using classes and inheritance. <br>
Then , you will be able to press the order now button - and you will be transfered to a summary window to confirm the order.<br>

P.S<br>
As a guitarist, i can promise that if you'll actually buy all the available products, you will make a great choice! ;-)
